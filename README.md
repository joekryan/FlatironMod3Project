# Movie Database Project
The aim of this project was to answer 2 business questions:
* What is the most popular genre of movie?
* When is the best time to release a movie?

For more information, please see the presentation.pdf file

## Methods Used

To gather the data, we first connected to the Movie Database API, downloaded data for films released in 2018 in two datasets then erged both datasets into a csv
We focused analysis on two dependent variables: average voter rating and revenue


To test these hypotheses we used the following methods: 

- Null Hypothesis
- T-test
- ANOVA
- Cohen's D
- Mann Whitney U Test
- Tukey Test
- Kruskal Wallis Test
- QQ Plots
